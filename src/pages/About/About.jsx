      <h1>Keeping Life Planitful</h1>
      <p>
        Plantiful aims to make your home plant care just a little bit easier.
        After all, you've got enough on your mind.

      <h2>How to use Plantiful</h2>
      <p>
        After creating a user profile, add the spaces in your home where you
        grow. Select one of the spaces, and add the plants you keep in them. The
        room will have temperature data as well as an air quality index, letting
        you know that the plants are doing their part to keep your air clean!
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll be able to select each plant to see their individual stats, like
        water and sun needs. You'll also be able to upload photos to assess
        their health externally. Make sure you get their good side!
      </p>
      <p>
        If your plant is in good health consistently, they'll get Ploints, which
        are Plant Points. These Ploints do...something tbd.

      <h1>Happy Planting!</h1>
